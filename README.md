# RL101: Reinforcement Learning 101 ‚Äî Agentic RL for LLMs

This repository provides a comprehensive, hands-on course transforming LLMs from passive text generators into autonomous agents through reinforcement learning. Based on "The Landscape of Agentic Reinforcement Learning for LLMs" survey, it bridges theory to implementation across planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception capabilities.

## Course Overview

**Duration**: 12-16 weeks  
**Prerequisites**: Basic ML knowledge, Python programming  
**Focus**: From MDP/POMDP foundations ‚Üí Agentic capabilities ‚Üí Real-world applications

This course reframes Large Language Models as **decision-making policies** in dynamic, partially observable environments rather than static sequence predictors. You'll learn how RL enables sophisticated behaviors like multi-step planning, tool coordination, persistent memory, and self-improvement.

## What You'll Build

- **Foundational Understanding**: MDP/POMDP formalizations contrasting PBRFT vs. Agentic RL
- **Capability Modules**: RL-driven planning, tool integration, memory systems, reasoning loops  
- **Task-Specific Agents**: Search/research, coding, mathematical, GUI, vision, and embodied agents
- **Production Systems**: Complete agentic architectures with evaluation frameworks
